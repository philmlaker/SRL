Defects in these enzymes result in decreased cortisol synthesis and absent feedback inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) with elevation of 17-OHPG.CAH is an inherited disorder caused by specific gene mutations; greater than 90% of cases are caused by a mutation in the steroid 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A) gene.   Less common forms of CAH are caused by deficiency of 17-hydroxylase or 11-hydroxylase.  Most cases of CAH are identified with newborn screening, however patients may present in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood.  Random 17-OHPG concentrations are usually diagnostic in classical forms of CAH, however random 17-OHPG concentrations may be within the normal range for individuals with non-classical CAH presenting in older children or adults.

Carefully insert the swab into the vagina about 2 inches (5 cm) past the introitus and gently rotate the swab for 10 to 30 seconds. Make sure the swab touches the walls of the vagina so that moisture is absorbed by the swab and then withdraw the swab without touching the skin.  4. While holding the swab in the same hand, unscrew the cap from the tube. Do not spill the contents of the tube. If the contents of the tube are spilled, use a new APTIMA Vaginal Swab Specimen Collection Kit.  5.

Clinical manifestation of BK infections include tubulointerstitial nephritis, also referred to as BK virus nephropathy (BKVN), and ureteral stenosis in kidney transplant recipients and hemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow transplant recipients.  Approximately 1-10% of renal transplant patients progress to BKVN and up to 80% of these patients may lose their grafts.  The onset of nephritis can occur as early as several days post-transplantation to as late as 5 years, with a mean period of 10 to 13 months post-transplantation.  The majority of BKVN manifestations occur within the first 2 years post-transplantation.A presumptive diagnosis of BKVN can be established if a patient has persistent viruria for more than two weeks in conjunction with greater than 10,000 copies/mL of BK virus DNA in plasma.  Hence, monitoring BK virus burden in patients who are at risk of developing BKVN is helpful in predicting the onset of nephropathy.

Make sure the swab touches the walls of the vagina so that moisture is absorbed by the swab and then withdraw the swab without touching the skin.  4.

Studies have attempted to correlate CMV baseline viral load with CMV disease status, however, there are no standardized or widely accepted thresholds for diagnosis. The recent introduction of the World Health Organization (WHO) international standard for CMV viral load reporting (IU/mL) may aid in developing standardized thresholds for the evaluation of CMV disease.Whole blood (test set U801) or plasma (test sets U820 or U821) may be used for quantitation of CMV burden.

CMV viral load is found to be higher in whole blood as both cell-free and intracellular viruses are detected. A 10-fold difference (1.0 log IU/mL) in viral load has been commonly documented between these two sample types. However, in a few patients up to 100-fold (2.0 log IU/mL) higher viral loads have been identified in whole blood samples compared to plasma, and occasionally the viral load in plasma was found to be higher than whole blood.

The panel includes prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) and hexagonal phase phospholipid neutralization to detect the presence of LA.  Initial testing includes PT, aPTT, and dRVVT screen.  If the aPTT is prolonged, aPTT 1:1 mixing study and Thrombin time are added.  If Thrombin time is prolonged, reptilase and heparin neutralization tests are added to detect the presence of unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin.The dRVVT screen result is used to generate a dRVVT screen ratio.  When the ratio is elevated, indicating possible LA, mixing studies are added to rule out deficiencies of Factors II, V, and X.   When patient plasma is mixed with normal pooled plasma, dRVVT clotting times will generally correct to normal if the initial prolongation was due to a factor deficiency and remain prolonged in the presence of LA. If the dRVVT mixing study remains prolonged, dRVVT confirm assay is performed.  The clotting times for both the dRVVT screen and confirm are utilized to calculate a ratio to indicate the presence or absence of LA.  If LA is not identified by the dRVVT-based testing when the dRVVT screen ratio is elevated or if the aPTT 1:1 mixing study remains prolonged, an additional integrated assay for LA is performed based on the addition of hexagonal phase phospholipids (Staclot LA).  Utilizing an LA sensitive reagent, an aPTT is performed on patient plasma incubated with and without additional hexagonal phase phospholipids.  LA inhibitors present in the patient specimen will be neutralized by hexagonal phase phospholipids and result in a shortened clotting time compared with the mixture which does not contain hexagonal phase phospholipids.

Patients who are at risk of developing or have already developed EBV-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) frequently have a significant increase in EBV viral load.  A study evaluating EBV viral burden in patients with evidence of PTLD reported an average four-fold increase in EBV viral load compared to immunosuppressed patients without evidence of PTLD.  While consensus on an acceptable EBV viral load cutoff for diagnosis of EBV-related disease is still not available, a rising EBV viral burden is an accepted risk for development of PTLD.  Definite diagnosis of PTLD is made by histologic evaluation of a tissue biopsy; however regularly monitoring of EBV viral load in whole blood, plasma or serum samples can aid in early detection of PTLD.  The majority of EBV-positive PTLD occurs in the first year post-transplantation and high-risk patients may be monitored frequently during the initial phase of the post-transplantation period.

Cholesterol in each subfraction is visualized with a lipophilic dye that binds proportionally to cholesterol in each lipoprotein particle.  The gels are scanned and analyzed with software that generates a profile of cholesterol content across all lipoprotein fractions.  Normal profiles consisting primarily of larger, buoyant LDL-1 and LDL-2 subfractions are designated as 'Type A'.  Profiles with predominantly smaller and denser subfractions, LDL-3 through LDL-7, are abnormal and designated as 'non-A'.  The non-A pattern is also called 'Type B' in the literature.  The non-A or type B pattern, with a predominance of small, dense lipoprotein particles, has been associated with risk of myocardial infarction and with response to diet therapy for coronary artery disease.

Based on the age at onset and disease severity, SMA can be divided into clinical subtypes. The most severe and most common form of SMA, type I or Werdnig-Hoffman, has onset of symptoms before six months of age and death from respiratory failure within the first two years of life. Type II SMA shows intermediate severity with onset before two years of age. Types III and IV have onset after 18 months of age with a variable symptom profile and may have normal life expectancies.SMA affects approximately 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 10,000 people and is one of the leading genetic causes of infant death. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for spinal muscular atrophy be offered to all women who are considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant. Estimated frequencies of SMA carriers are 1:35 for Caucasians, 1:41 for Ashkenazi Jews, 1:53 for Asians, 1:66 for African-Americans and 1:117 for Hispanics (Carrier screening for Genetic Conditions. Committee Opinion No. 691. ACOG. Obstet Gynecol 2017;129:e41-55).Two nearly identical genes, telomeric Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) and centromeric Survival Motor Neuron 2 (SMN2), play pivotal roles in SMA. More than 95% of SMA carriers show deletion of at least exon 7 of the SMN1 gene. Intragenic SMN1 pathogenic variants account for the remaining causative mutations. De novo deletion of exon 7 of one SMN1 gene occurs in approximately 2% of SMA patients.The SRL assay utilizes Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) for detection of copy number variants and variants linked to the silent carrier haplotype. Copy number variants of SMN1 are (NM_000344.3) exon 7 c.840C and exon 8 c.*293G; and SMN2 (NM_017411.3) exon 7 c.840T. The haplotype variants associated with SMN1 silent carriers are SMN1 c.*3+80T>G and c.*211_*212del.",This test has components designated by the manufacturer as 'For Research Use Only'.
